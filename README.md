## Installation

You can set up your own version of the site as follows:

1. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/NachoToast/220-tools).
2. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
3. Download dependencies using <span title="Comes with NodeJS">npm</span> or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

    ```sh
    yarn # yarn

    npm install # npm
    ```

To work in hot-reload mode, I recommend using the [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VSCode. Simply 'Go Live' and run the `dev` script:

```sh
yarn dev # yarn

npm run dev # npm
```
